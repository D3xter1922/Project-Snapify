# Snapatar Game snap

Snapatar for gaming enables developers to bring their web2 games to web3 and create an interconnected ecosystem of games that support sharing of assets and progression using NFTs, while also maintaining anonymity. 
## Snapatar for gaming adds the following functionalities:
### 1. Shared Accounts: 
We introduce the concept shared account. It is utilizing “snap_manageState” the ability to store data locally in the metamask wallet to support in app logins, that store fundamental information for the user.
### 2. Mutable Player Data sharing:
Developers can use this to easily facilitate sharing and managing of mutable data, such as player progression, inventory and stats. that is authorised by owning an nft that holds the key to unlock the encoded data. This enables anonymous sharing of player data while also maintaining full security.
### 3. Immutable asset sharing: 
We implement a system to make it trivial for developers to integrate sharing and owning of in game assets, cosmetics or collectibles in their existing web2 game. This is done by mapping each asset to a key, and then storing them as NFTs. This paves way for the economy of the metaverse.
